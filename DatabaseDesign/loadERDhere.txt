Car Dealership Database

The purpose of this database is to store the customers orders in a car dealership that sells electric vehicles of different makes like Ford, GM and Tesla. The dealership follows a manufacturing principle wherein the manufacturing process starts after the customer has placed an order.
The requirements of this database are as follows:
1.	Every brand of car has multiple car models in them.
2.	Every car has a model number and a unique identification number.
3.	Every car has unique order number and manufacturing details.
